Comp Graphics

This project has been the largest undertaking so far in the program.

In developing this scene, I learned about an entire new external library within C++, having never utilized OpenGL prior. This built the skills of learning to work with this new library, while also building practice in trusting that I don't need to know every aspect of how the library works before utilizing it.
The design process primarily followed an experimental direction, reading the resources and watching the videos for each week, and then applying each new skill in isolation and ensuring functionality before applying it to the scene. Many of the steps forward in building my scene came without expectation, focusing on spending time simply trying to understand the requirements for the week rather than applyig the pressure of trying to specifically meet deadlines for the assignment. I felt that this led to a deeper understanding of OpenGL, as well as feeling more free to experiment in building functionality, such as texturing each object differently, when each example provided from the text focused on applying the same texture to each object.

Iteration was a large part of the strategies I implemented in working on this scene, making small adjustments to improve readability and efforts at refactoring during that time. This was scene largely through externalizing shader programs to separate functions rather than fruitlessly trying to figure out how to generalize out a function for setting up each shape's vertices. This also resulted in focus on trying to externalize to functions where available as I stepped into texturing and lighting.

Computational graphics is tied to a large part of the software industry, with a significant number of programs utilizing 3d rendering as a way to represent models and worlds even outside of the video game and animation industries which arguably use rendering the most. While I am far from an expert in OpenGL after this course, I have the fundamental skills needed to continue building expertise as I move forward in my career.
